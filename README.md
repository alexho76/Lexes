Lexes is a personal dictionary solution with capability for Anki export, flexible text-list import, auto-definition retrieval using Wikipedia API, and sharing dictionaries. It is designed to speed up the tedious manual flashcard creation process seen in many flashcard programs, and help students manage their study and revision with ease. Use it to organise and stay on top of your subject-specific vocabulary, or to effortlessly create flashcards for your favourite flashcard program.
